     <div class="about-text">
  <p>
    Hi, I'm <span class="highlight-line">Dhanasankar K</span>, an enthusiastic and dedicated 
    <span class="highlight-line">Electronics and Communication Engineering</span> graduate (B.E., Class of 2025) 
    with a deep-rooted passion for <span class="highlight-line">digital system design</span> at the hardware level. 
    My academic journey and hands-on projects have shaped a strong foundation in 
    <span class="highlight-line">digital electronics</span>, with a particular interest in 
    <span class="highlight-line">Verilog-based RTL design</span>, 
    <span class="highlight-line">FPGA implementation</span>, and 
    <span class="highlight-line">real-time system simulation</span>. I am highly motivated by the challenge of 
    solving real-world problems through precise, <span class="highlight-line">bit-level control</span>, and I enjoy 
    the intricacies of developing optimized and reliable <span class="highlight-line">hardware logic</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I am undergoing advanced <span class="highlight-line">Design Verification (DV)</span> training at 
    <span class="highlight-line">Silicon Craft VLSI Training & Research Institute</span>, Chennai, where I am 
    expanding my expertise in <span class="highlight-line">Verilog</span>, 
    <span class="highlight-line">SystemVerilog</span>, and the 
    <span class="highlight-line">Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)</span>. My current focus is on 
    mastering <span class="highlight-line">SystemVerilog</span> for 
    <span class="highlight-line">functional verification</span>, developing 
    <span class="highlight-line">constrained-random environments</span>, and gaining exposure to 
    <span class="highlight-line">protocol-level testing</span> — all of which are driving me toward a successful 
    career in the <span class="highlight-line">semiconductor</span> and 
    <span class="highlight-line">VLSI design</span> domain. With a combination of 
    <span class="highlight-line">theoretical knowledge</span> and 
    <span class="highlight-line">practical experience</span>, I am eager to contribute to 
    cutting-edge <span class="highlight-line">digital hardware design</span> and 
    <span class="highlight-line">verification projects</span>.
  </p>

        <h3 class="subheading">Areas of Passion</h3>
