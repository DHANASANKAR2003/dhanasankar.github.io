        <p>
          I am <strong>Dhanasankar K</strong>, a passionate and aspiring electronics engineer currently pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in 
          <strong>Electronics and Communication Engineering</strong> at 
          <strong>Government College of Engineering, Erode</strong> (2021–2025). I have a strong foundation in digital systems and VLSI design, and I am actively honing 
          my skills in Verilog, FPGA development, and embedded systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          My academic journey began at <strong>Government Boys Higher Secondary School, Gandharvakottai</strong>, in 
          <strong>Pudukkottai District</strong>, where I developed a deep interest in mathematics and logical reasoning. These interests naturally led me to explore 
          the world of digital electronics, which continues to fuel my motivation for building real-time systems and innovative hardware solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am highly dedicated, quick to learn, and always excited to take on new challenges. Whether it’s building a secure digital voting machine using FSMs 
          or implementing a real-time Sobel edge detection system on FPGA, I approach every project with passion and precision. I’m committed to growing in 
          the semiconductor industry and contributing meaningfully through continuous learning, problem-solving, and collaboration.
